        <p>Current I am studies major course of pre-engineering at Addis Ababa
             university EIABC campus after completed this course I think we can
              choose  sub field of engineering I will first choice is architecture . I am interests to design and building construction. then studies architecture I am professional designer in the world and I will come up to the Ethiopian name and yourself on to the world
            My future plan After I graduate, one of my goals related to my
             education is to attend very hard work influence in develop our country
              and I will demonstration for Ethiopian inviter. While in college I want 
              to be as involved as I can possibly be during those five years.
             I want to create an impact in my community and hopefully the world as well. Community service that I will be participating in will provide me with the experience that I need to be a better-rounded individual. These experiences in turn will help me become a better social worker in the future.
             Also during college, I want to get an internship in our country so that
              I can have more experience in my future field of work. The situations 
              that I will encounter not only affect my clients, but also myself.
